## Model & Setup
The provided model lets you simulate a BLDC motor which is driven by a three-phase inverter. A snapshot of the model is given below.

In the model, the BLDC motor is set up to have a single pole pair in the rotor and the three-phase inverter is driven with a static switching pattern simultaneously energizing phases A and C. The following animation shows the resulting rotor alignment.

You can do the following with the provided files:

- Run Simulink model (Modeling_three_phase_inverter.slx) and observe angular position and speed responses of the BLDC motor using the provided scopes.

- Run MATLAB file (animateRotorPosition.m) to create the BLDC motor animation seen above (also at 7:23 in the video). After running the MATLAB file, press any button to start the animation. The MATLAB file runs the Simulink model, and uses the simulated data to animate the BLDC motor.
