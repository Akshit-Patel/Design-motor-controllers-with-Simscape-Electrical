This repository consists of folders containing the MATLAB and Simulink files that are used in the [How to Design Motor Controllers Using Simscape Electrical](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDgvBZbnfPw&list=PLn8PRpmsu08pqegLB5CqfgZCtuK5UKIrx) video series:

1-Simulate back-EMF voltage of a BLDC motor
2-Modeling a three-phase inverter
3-Modeling commutation logic
4-Modeling a PWM-controlled buck converter
5-PWM Control of a BLDC motor

Check out [this tech talk video series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLn8PRpmsu08qL-EG3DRMtRyokpXQJyhp7) to understand: 
  
- How brushless DC motors differ from brushed DC motors and how they work
- How BLDC motors can be controlled using six-step commutation (trapezoidal control)
- The different components of a BLDC motor control algorithm such as PWM control, commutation logic, three-phase inverter and sensor
